## Secure Medical Data Project - Current Progress

### ‚úÖ Project Overview
This project simulates a secure medical data handling system with a focus on protecting against membership inference attacks (MIA). It incorporates various security techniques, including differential privacy, PII redaction, access control, and file encryption, to ensure data confidentiality and user privacy.
